# Trails Board Game Digital Recreation

This project is a digital recreation of the Trails board game, implemented as a JavaScript application using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. I wanted the challenge of coming up with the logic to implement smooth gameplay. Although the functionality is not completed yet, I have been able to recreate some items from the games such as the badges and trail tiles (both for 2-3/4 players and day/night sides of the tiles).

## Project Overviews

Trails is a board game where players hike along trails, collecting resources and completing objectives. This digital version aims to capture the essence of the physical game while leveraging web technologies for an interactive experience.

## Technologies Used
