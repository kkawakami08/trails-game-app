# Trails Game App

This project is a recreation of the **TRAILS** board game, developed as a part of my coding portfolio. The application is built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** to enhance design flexibility and functionality. The board game combines beautiful visuals with thoughtful mechanics to create an engaging experience, so I wanted to try and emulate it as best I can. While the logic for gameplay is still in progress, the design aspects are largely complete. (\*This application was meant for tablet sized screen and bigger due to the trail path and many game components)

## Current Features

- **Trail Path Layout**: The trail path layout is dynamically rendered based on the number of players and whether it's the user's first time playing the game.
- **Components**:
  - **Trail Locations**: I streamlined the design by using 2 components rather than 7 individual ones for each trail location.
  - **Badge Component**: The badge component represents key game elements with attributes like:
    - Resource type
    - Points
    - Birds
    - Actions
    - Cost
    - Image
    - Background color
    - Tooltip descriptions for player guidance

## Tools & Technologies

- **React**: For efficient component-based UI rendering.
- **Vite**: Ensures a fast development build process.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling, making the layout responsive and visually appealing.
- **Figma**: Initial design and color schemes were drafted in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/board/lc7dZBVL7oij73iVQMnRxD/Trails---Game-App?node-id=0-1&t=ZoAZj0LtIEAR3tSy-1) before being implemented into code.

## Upcoming Features

- **Game Logic**: Integration of full gameplay mechanics, including player actions, resource management, and score calculation.
- **Improved User Experience**: Further refinement of user interactions
